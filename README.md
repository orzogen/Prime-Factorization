##About

This is a simple Ruby script I made for finding the prime factorization of a number. It's not very good, and you probably have no reason to use it.

##Usage
The method returns the prime factorization of a number as an array of factors. It is used by calling ``` .primes``` on a number. For instance: ``` 648312.primes => [2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 17, 227]```. This will only work for numbers of type Fixnum.
