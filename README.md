##About

This is a simple Ruby script I made for finding the prime factorization of a number. It's not very good, and you probably have no reason to use it.

##Usage
You can get the prime factorization of a number by calling '''ruby .prime ''' on a number.
For instance: '''ruby 648312.primes => [2, 2, 2, 3, 7, 17, 227]'''
